# Teams²
Microsoft Teams in a web browser made nicer

Microsoft Teams - by Microsoft Corporation - is a collaboration application designed to help teams, businesses, and teachers work on projects together.

There are, however, some downsides to the application. The desktop application itself does not allow for multiple accounts (account switching), and is quite heavy on computer resources. So, as a solution, this is Teams² - Microsoft Teams running in its web browser form - with a much nicer feel, without all the extra browser stuff.

It works and feels just like the desktop application. Enjoy!
